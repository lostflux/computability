  How familiar are you with proof-based math?
  \begin{answer}
    I am very familiar with proof-based math, having done
    a lot of it in my previous courses.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item MATH 22 (Linear Algebra)
      \item MATH 63 (Real Analysis)
      \item MATH 69 (Logic)
      \item MATH 71 (Algebra)
      \item MATH 75 (Cryptography)
      \item MATH 100 (Game Theory)
      \item COSC 30 (Discrete Mathematics)
      \item COSC 31 (Algorithms)
      \item COSC 39 (Theory of Computation)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{answer}

\begin{problem}
  How comfortable are you with proof-based math?
  \begin{answer}
    I feel comfortable with proof-based math.
    The only caveat I feel is that it always takes me a while
    to learn how to write proofs in a new context
    especially if there is a lot of notation involved.
  \end{answer}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Are there any specific proof techniques or writing strategies
  youâ€™d like to improve on throughout the course?
  \begin{answer}
    I am not sure yet about specific proof techniques,
    but I am most excited to learn new ideas,
    especially having some context around
    computability (coming from decidability in Logic
    and P/NP in Algorithms \& Automata/Language Theory).

    I am also trying to explore \newterm{$\lambda$-calculus}
    and functional programming (I have some experience with Haskell),
    so I am hoping to find some interesting ways to explore them
    in the context of computability---especially since the
    final project is open-ended.
