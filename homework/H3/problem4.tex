\begin{problem}
  Prove that every infinite c.e. set contains an infinite computable subset.

  \begin{answer}
    Let $X$ be an infinite c.e. set.
    This means that $X = W_e$ for some $e$.
    Precisely, running $\varphi_e$ on input $n$ will \emph{always}
    halt if $n \in X$, but it may diverge if $n \not \in X$.

    We will construct a computable subset $Y$ of $X$,
    \[ Y \coloneq \set{ x \in X \given \varphi_e(x) \text{ halts in $x$ or less steps}}. \]

    \step
    \begin{algorithm}[H]\label{alg:Y}
      \SetAlgorithmName{$\mathsf{T} \mathsf{M}$}{}{}
      \caption{Compute $\chi_Y$}
      On input $n$: \\
      \For{$i = 0, 1, \ldots, n$}{
        Run $\varphi_e$ on $n$ for $n$ steps. \\
        \If{$\varphi_e$ halts}{
          \textbf{output} $1$
        }
      }
      \textbf{output} $0$
    \end{algorithm}

    \step
    \emph{
      NOTE: For non-integer inputs,
      let $\varphi_e$ run for as many steps as the index of the input
      in some ordering system.
    }

    \step
    We claim that the machine always halts for any $n$,
    and outputs either $1$ or $0$.
    For any fixed $n$, the loop eventually either halts for some $i \leq \abs{n}$
    and outputs $1$, or halts on the $\abs{n}$-th iteration and outputs $0$.

    \crim{
      I got stuck on showing that $Y$ is infinite,
      which made me realize that I might have been heading in the wrong direction
      but I didn't have time to correct my approach.
    }
  \end{answer}
