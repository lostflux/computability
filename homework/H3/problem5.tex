\begin{problem}
  Prove that every total computable function has
  infinitely many fixed points.

  \begin{answer}

    We will show that every total computable function has infinitely many fixed points
    using the Recursion Theorem with Parameters.

    \begin{theorem}{Recursion Theorem with Parameters} \\
      Let $f : \N^{k+1} \to \N$ be a total computable function.
      Then there exists a total computable function $r : \N^k \to \N$ such that
      \[
        \varphi_{r(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_l)} = \varphi_{f(r(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_k), x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_k)}.
      \]
    \end{theorem}


    \begin{definition}
      For a function $f : \N \to \N$, $e$ is a \emph{fixed point} of $f$
      if \[ \varphi_e = \varphi_{f(e)}. \]
    \end{definition}

    % \begin{theorem}{s-m-n Theorem} \\
    %   For any $n$ and $m$, there is an injective, total computable function
    %   $s^m_n : \N^{n+1} \to \N$ such that, for all $e$,
    %   \[
    %     \varphi_e(y_0, \ldots, y_{m-1}, x_0, \ldots, x_{n-1}) = \varphi_{s^m_n(e, x_0, \ldots, x_n)}(y_0, \ldots, y_{m-1}).
    %   \]
    % \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
      Let $f : \N^{k+1} \to \N$ be a total computable function.
      Pick $r : \N^k \to \N$ per the Recursion Theorem with Parameters,
      so that for all $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{k-1}$,
      \[
        \varphi_{r(x_0, \ldots, x_{k-1})} = \varphi_{f(r(x_0, \ldots, x_{k-1}), x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{k-1})},
      \]
      and $r$ is injective and total computable.

      Since $x_0, \ldots, x_{k-1}$ occur as free parameters, this means that
      there are infintely many combinations of $x_0, \ldots, x_{k-1}$ that
      $\varphi_{r(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{k-1})} = \varphi_{f(r(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{k-1}), x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{k-1})}$,
      hence $f$ has infinitely many fixed points.
    \end{proof}
