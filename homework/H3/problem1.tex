\begin{problem}
  Is there a fastest growing total computable function,
  i.e. a function $f : \N \to \N$ such that
  \[ f(n + 1) - f(n) \geq \varphi_e(n + 1) - \varphi_e(n) \]
  for all $e$ such that $\varphi_e$ is total and all $n$?
  Prove that your answer is correct.

  \begin{answer}
    No, there is no fastest growing total computable function.
    
    \begin{proof}
      Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists such a fastest growing total computable function $f$.
      This implies:
      \begin{enumarabic}
        \item $f$ is total computable.\label{1:computable}
        \item For all $e$ such that $\varphi_e$ is total computable and for all $n \in \N$,
          $f(n + 1) - f(n) \geq \varphi_e(n + 1) - \varphi_e(n)$.~\label{1:fastest}
      \end{enumarabic}

      We'll show that for any such $f$, we can construct a new total computable function $g$ that grows faster than $f$.
      Define $g$ as follows:
      \begin{align*}
        g : \N &\to \N \\
        n &\mapsto f(n)^2
      \end{align*}

      \begin{enumarabic}
        \item $g$ is total computable because $f$ is total computable 
          and squaring a natural number is total computable,
          so their composition is also total computable.
        \item We claim that $g$ grows faster than $f$ for all $n \in \N$.

          Given the assumption that $f$ is the fastest growing function,
          we see that $f(n+1) - f(n) \geq 2$ since it has to outgrow the total computable function
          $\mathbf{double}(n) = 2n$. \\
          \emph{Since $f(n) \geq 0$ for all $n \in \N$, this implies that $f(n+1) + f(n) \geq 2$.}
          Therefore:
          \begin{align*}
            g(n + 1) - g(n) &= f(n + 1)^2 - f(n)^2 \\
                            &= \crim{(f(n + 1) + f(n))}\zaff{(f(n + 1) - f(n))} \\
                            &\geq 2 \parens{f(n + 1) - f(n)} \\
                            &> f(n + 1) - f(n)
          \end{align*}
      \end{enumarabic}
      Since $g$ is total computable there exists some $e$ such that
      $\varphi_e(n+1) - \varphi_e(n) > f(n+1) - f(n)$
      for all $n \in \N$.
      This contradicts the assumption that $f$ was the fastest growing function.
    \end{proof}
