\begin{problem}
  Are there sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A' \leq_T B'$
  but $A \not\leq_T B$?
  Justify your answer.

  \begin{answer}
    \newterm{Yes}.

    Pick $B = \emptyset$, which is computable,
    and let $A$ be any non-computable set that is $\low$,
    meaning $\emptyset' \equiv_T A'$.
    \emph{
      As we showed in class using
      the \newterm{Low Basis Theorem} and \newterm{Sacks' Splitting Theorem},
      such sets exist (and in fact, there are many of them).
    }
    Then:
    \begin{enumarabic}
      \item Since $B$ is computable but $A$ is non-computable, \newline
        $A$ has a higher Turing degree than $B$, so
        $\blue{A \not\leq_T B}$.
      \item Since, $B' = \emptyset'$ and $A' \equiv_T \emptyset'$,
        meaning $A' \equiv_T B'$.
        Therefore, $\blue{A' \leq_T B'}$ and $B' \leq_T A'$.
    \end{enumarabic}
