\begin{problem}
  Are there sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A' \leq_T B'$
  but $A \not\leq_T B$?
  Justify your answer.

  \begin{answer}
    \newterm{Yes}.

    Pick $B = \emptyset$ --- which is computable ---
    and let $A$ be any non-computable set that is $\low$,
    meaning $\emptyset' \equiv_T A'$
    \emph{
      As we showed in class using
      the Low Basis Theorem and Sacks' Splitting Theorem,
      such sets exist (and in fact, there are many of them).
    }
    Then:
    \begin{enumarabic}
      \item Since $B$ is computable but $A$ is non-computable,
        $A \not\leq_T B$.
      \item However, $A' = \emptyset'$ and $B' \equiv_T \emptyset'$,
        meaning $A' \equiv_T B'$.
        Therefore, $A' \leq_T B'$.
    \end{enumarabic}
  \end{answer}
