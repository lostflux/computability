\begin{problem}
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Prove that if there is $g \leq_T X$ such that
      $\varphi_{g(x)} \neq \varphi_x$, then there is
      $h \leq_T X$ such that $h(e) \neq \varphi_e(e)$
      for all $e$.

      \begin{answer}
        This means that $g$ is fixed point-free.
        Define $h$ as follows:
        \[
          h(e) = g(\varphi_e(e)).
        \]

        \begin{enumarabic}
          \item First, note that $\varphi_{g(x)} \neq \varphi_x$
            means that $g(x) \neq x$ for all $x$,
            as that would trivially imply $\varphi_{g(x)} = \varphi_x$
            for some $x$.
            Therefore, $h(e) = g(\varphi_e(e)) \neq \varphi_e(e)$
            for all $e$.
          \item Next, we show that $h \leq_T X$.
            Since $g \leq_T X$, we can use $X$ as an oracle to compute $g(e)$
            for any $e$. Specifically, there exists an oracle machine $k$
            that uses $X$ as an oracle to compute $g$, such that
            $\Phi_k^X(e) = g(e)$ for all $e$.
            We can compute $h(e)$ by simulating $\varPhi_k^X(\varphi_e(e))$
            and returning the result, thus $h$ can also be computed
            by an oracle machine that takes $X$ as an oracle
            and, on input $e$, simulates $\varPhi_k^X$ on $\varphi_e(e)$.
        \end{enumarabic}
      \end{answer}

    \item Given $h \leq_T X$ such that $h(e) \neq \varphi_e(e)$ for all $e$,
      show that there is $f \leq_T X$ such that $W_{f(e)} \neq W_e$
      for all $e$. \newline
      \emph{Hint: make $\abs{W_{f(e)}} = 1$.}

      \begin{answer}

        For each $e$, define $e'$ such that:
        \[
          \varphi_{e'}(x) = \begin{cases}
            h(e) & \text{if } x = e \\
            \diverges & \text{otherwise.}
          \end{cases}
        \]

        This ensures that for any $e$, $\varphi_{e'}(e) = h(e) \neq \varphi_e(e)$,
        and $W_{e'} = \set{ e }$ for all $e$ and corresponding $e'$.

        Finally, define $f$ as follows:
        \[
          f(x) = (x + 1)'.
        \]

        \begin{enumarabic}
          \item First, since $f(e) = (e + 1)'$,
            $W_{f(e)} = \set{ e + 1 } \neq \set{ e } = W_e$.
          \item Next, we show that $f \leq_T X$.
            Since $X$ is an oracle for $h$, we can use $X$ to compute $h(e)$
            for any $e$. Specifically, there exists an oracle machine $k$
            that uses $X$ as an oracle to compute $h$, such that
            $\Phi_k^X(e) = h(e)$ for all $e$.
            We can compute $f$ as follows: \newline
            \emph{
              On input $e$, construct an oracle machine that,
              on input $x$, simulates $\Phi_k^X(x)$ if $x = e + 1$,
              and otherwise diverges. \\
              Return the code of this machine as $f(e)$.
            }
