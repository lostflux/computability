  Prove that no ML-random set has an infinite c.e. subset
  (i.e., every ML-random set is immune). \newline
  \emph{Hint: use a lemma from the class notes}.

  \begin{answer}
    In the class notes, we proved that no ML-random set has an
    infinite computable subset.
    We can use this result to prove that no ML-random set has an
    infinite c.e. subset by way of contradiction.

    Suppose $R$ is an ML-random set with an infinite c.e. subset $A \subseteq B$.
    
    First, note that every c.e. set has a computable subset.
    Specifically, given $A$ is c.e., then we can computably
    enumerate members of $A$.
    Let $a_i$ be the $i$th element enumerated in $A$.
    Define \[ A' = \set{ a_i \given a_i > a_j \text{ for all } j < i }. \]
    That is, $A'$ is set of elements in a \emph{unique} and
    \emph{strictly increasing} sequence of members of $A$.

    We claim that $A'$ is computable.
    Specifically, given any $x$, we can enumerate members of $A$
    until we either list $x$, then we know $x \in A'$,
    or we list a number greater than $x$, then we know $x \notin A'$.

    Thus: if an ML-random set $R$ has an infinite c.e. subset $A$,
    then it necessarily has an infinite computable subset $A' \subseteq A \subseteq R$.
    However, the lemma tells us that no ML-random set can have an
    infinite computable subset, so it must be the case that
    $R$ cannot have an infinite c.e. subset either.
