\begin{problem}
  Let $B$ be an infinite c.e. set.
  Is there an immune set $I$ such that $B \leq_1 I$?
  Justify your answer.

  \begin{answer}
    \emph{No, there is no immune set $I$ such that $B \leq_1 I$.}

    Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is an immune set
    $I$ such that $B \leq_1 I$,
    with $f_I : \omega \to \omega$ being an computable, injective function that
    witnesses the reduction.
    Since $B$ is c.e., there exists a total, computable, injective function
    $f_B : \omega \to \omega$ such that $B = \range(f_B)$
    (\emph{we proved this result in a previous assignment}).

    Consider the composition $f \coloneq f_B \circ f_I$.
    \begin{enumarabic}
      \item Since both $f_B$ and $f_I$ are injective, so is $f$.
      \item Since $f_B$ is total and computable, and $f_I$ is total and computable,
        so is $f$.
      \item Since $\range{f_B} = B$ and $f_I$ is injective
        from $B$ to $I$;
        \[ \range{f} = f_I(\range{f_B}) f_I(B) = I \]
    \end{enumarabic}

    Thus, $I$ is the range of $f$, which implies that $I$ is c.e., hence not immune.
    This contradicts the fact that $I$ is immune.
    Therefore, the assumption that such an $I$ exists must be wrong.

    \step
    \crim{
      Notation wise, given a set $S$, we denote by $f(S)$ to be the image of $S$ under $f$:
      \[ f(S) = \set{f(n) \mid n \in S}. \]
    }
  \end{answer}
