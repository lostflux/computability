\begin{problem}
  Show that if $C$ is a computable set, then $C \leq_m X$ for any set
  $X$ which is nonempty and has nonempty complement.

  \begin{answer}
    Let $C$ be a computable set and $X$ be a set which is nonempty and
    has nonempty complement.  Since $X$ is nonempty and has nonempty complement,
    there is some $x \in X$ and some $y \not\in X$.
    Define the function $f$ by
    \[
      f(n) = \begin{cases}
        x & \text{if } n \in C, \\
        y & \text{if } n \not\in C.
      \end{cases}
    \]
    Since $C$ is computable, there is some Turing machine $\varphi_e$
    which computes $\chi_C$, hence given any input $n$, $\varphi_e$
    can determine whether $n \in C$ or $n \not \in C$.
    Therefore, $f$ is computable. We claim that $C
    \leq_m X$ via $f$.  To see this, note that $n \in C$ if and only
    if $f(n) = x \in X$, and $n \not\in C$ if and only if $f(n) = y
    \not\in X$.  Thus, $n \in C$ if and only if $f(n) \in X$, which
    shows that $C \leq_m X$.
