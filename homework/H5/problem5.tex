\begin{problem}
  Given a countable sequence of sets $\set{A_i}_{i \in \omega}$,
  define the \emph{infinite join}
  $A = \join_{i \in \omega} A_i$ by
  \[
    A = \set{\vector{i, n} \mid n \in A_i}.  
  \]

  Prove that there are sequences $\set{A_i}_{i \in \omega}$ and $\set{B_i}_{i \in \omega}$
  such that $A_i \equiv_T B_i$ for all $i$< but $A \not\equiv_T B$.
  In other words, this operation is defined on sets, but not on
  degrees (unlike the finite joins). \\
  \emph{
    Hint: make $A$ computable but $B$ not computable.
  }
