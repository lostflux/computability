\begin{problem}
  $A \join B$, ``$A$ join $B$'', is defined as
  \[
    A \join B = \{ 2x \mid x \in A \} \cup \{ 2x+1 \mid x \in B \}.
  \]

  Prove that thfe Turing degree of $A \join B$ is a least upper bound
  of the Turing degrees of $A$ and $B$.
  In other words, show that it computes both $A$ and $B$,
  and that any $C$ which computes both $A$ and $B$
  also computes $A \join B$.
