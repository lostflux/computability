\begin{problem}
  Are there uncountably many Turing degrees?
  Justify your answer.

  \begin{answer}
    \emph{Yes, there are uncountably many Turing degrees.}

    \step
    For any set $A$, there are countably many sets $B$ such that $B \equiv_T A$
    since for each $B$, $\chi_A = \Phi_e^B$ for some $e \in \omega$,
    and there are countably many such $e$.
    Thus, each Turing degree contains countably many sets,
    yet there are $2^{\abs{\omega}} = 2^{\aleph_0}$ subsets of $\omega$.
    Since $2^{\aleph_0}$ is uncountable,
    and each Turing degree can only contain countably many sets,
    there must be uncountably many Turing degrees.
