\begin{problem}
  Suppose $C$ is the set of valid codes for machines based on
  our coding scheme defined in class. Give a total, computable
  bijection from $\omega$ to $C$,
  i.e. a computable function which associates every natural number
  to a unique machine. 

  \begin{answer}
    Since $C$ is c.e.,
    we can enumerate it as $C = \set{ e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots }$.
    Define the function $f : \N \to C$ by $f(n) = e_n$.
    Then $f$ is total, computable, and bijective.
  \end{answer}
