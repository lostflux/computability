\begin{problem}
  Suppose $C$ is the set of valid codes for machines based on
  our coding scheme defined in class. Give a total, computable
  bijection from $\omega$ to $C$,
  i.e. a computable function which associates every natural number
  to a unique machine. 

  \begin{answer}
    The set of all valid codes, $C$, is is c.e.
    and can be enumerated by iterating through
    all possible codes $1, 2, 3, \ldots$ and checking if
    $\varphi_i$ is a valid machine.
    List the code for the first valid machine as $c_1$,
    the code for the second valid machine as $c_2$, and so on.
    Then define $f : \N \to C$ with $f(n) = c_n$.
    
    \step
    Since there are infinite machines, given any $n \in \N$,
    eventually a unique code $c_n$ will be listed in $C$.
    Therefore, every $n \in \N$ is associated with a unique code
    for a valid machine, so $f$ is total and bijective.

    \step
    The function $f$ is also computable since it can be
    simulated by a Turing Machine that, on input $n$,
    enumerates through all codes $1, 2, 3, \ldots$
    until it finds the $n$-th valid code $c_n$ and returns it.
  \end{answer}
