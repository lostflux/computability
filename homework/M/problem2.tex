\begin{problem}
  Prove that no index set is immune.

  % \begin{definition}
  %   A set $S$ is an \emph{index set} if it contains the codes of
  %   partial computable functions.
  % \end{definition}

  \begin{answer}
    A set $S$ is \emph{immune} if $A$ is infinite but has no
    infinite c.e. subset.

    To show that no index set is immune, we will show that every index set
    contains some infinite c.e. subset.

    Let $I$ be an non-empty index set.
    By the properties of index sets,
    whenever $\varphi_i = \varphi_j$, then $i \in I$
    \emph{if and only if} $j \in I$.
    The padding lemma tells us that any such element $i \in I$
    has infinitely many indices $j \in I$ such that
    $\varphi_i = \varphi_j$.

    We can construct a c.e. set $S \subseteq I$ as follows.

    \begin{enumarabic}
      \item Find an arbitrary index $e \in I$ having
        $\varphi_e(n) \converges$ some specific input $n \in \N$.
        Since index sets contain codes of (partial) computable functions,
        such an $e$ and $n$ exists.
      \item Define $S$ as;
        \begin{align*}
          S &= \set{ i \in I \given \varphi_i(n) \converges = \varphi_e(n) }
        \end{align*}
        That is --- $S$ is the set of indices in $I$ that converge to the same
        output as $\varphi_e$ on input $n$.

      \item We claim that $S$ is c.e.
        We can construct a bijection $f : \N \to S$ as follows:
        \begin{enumroman}
          \item Let $s_0 = \varphi_e$ and $S_0 = \set{ s_0 }$.
          \item For each $i \in \set{1, 2, 3, \ldots}$,
            let \[ s_i = k \text{ such that } \varphi_k \in S \land \varphi_k \not \in S_{i-1} \]
             \[ S_i = \set{ s_i } \cup S_{i-1}.\]
          \item Define $f : \N \to S$ as $f(n) = s_n$.
        \end{enumroman}
    \end{enumarabic}
  \end{answer}
