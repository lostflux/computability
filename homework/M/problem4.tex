\begin{problem}
  Let $M$ be the set
  \[ \set{ x \given \forall y < x \parens{ \varphi_x \neq \varphi_y } }. \]
  That is, $M$ is the set of minimal indices of computable functions:
  the smallest indices which define a given (partial) computable function.

    \item Is $M$ immune? Simple?
      \begin{answer}
        \newterm{$M$ is immune but not simple.}

        \subsection*{Immunity}
        A set is immune if it is infinite but has no infinite c.e. subset.

        While $M$ is infinite, it does not contain any infinite c.e. subset.
        For the sake of contradiction, suppose it did
        and let the subset be $S$.
        Then there exists a bijection $f : \N \to S$ (since $S$ is c.e.).
        By the recursion theorem, there exists a fixed point $e$
        such that $e \neq f(e)$ and $\varphi_e = \varphi_{f(e)}$.
        But since $f$ is a bijection, $f(e) \in S \subset M$,
        so either $e$ is not minimal or $f(e)$ is not minimal,
        and both cases contradict the constitution of $M$.

        \subsection*{Simplicity}
        A set is simple if it is c.e. and its complement is immune.
        Since no immune set is c.e., $M$ cannot be simple.
        
      \end{answer}

    \item Is $M$ productive? Creative?
      \begin{answer}

        \subsection*{Productivity}
        Since $M$ is immune, $M$ is not productive. \\
        Given a productive set $P$,
        the productive function $\psi$
        can be used to generate a c.e. subset of of $P$,
        so no productive set can be immune.

        \subsection*{Creativity}
        Since $M$ is immune, $M$ is not c.e.,
        hence not creative.
