\begin{problem}
  We say that $X =^\ast Y$ if $X$ and $Y$ agree on all but
  finitely many numbers.
  Show that there are sequences of sets
  $\set{A_n}_{n \in \omega}$ and $\set{B_n}_{n \in \omega}$
  such that $A_n =^\ast B_n$ for all $n$,
  but $\displaystyle \bigjoin_{n \in \omega} A_n \not=^\ast \bigjoin_{n \in \omega} B_n$.

  \begin{answer}
    Let $A_n = \set{2n}$ and $B_n = \set{2n+1}$.
    Then $A_n =^\ast B_n$ for all $n$,
    since $A_n$ and $B_n$ are disjoint,
    but they are each singleton sets,
    meaning they agree on all elements except for two:
    $2n$ and $2n+1$.

    \step
    However, $\displaystyle\bigjoin_{n \in \omega} A_n = \set{0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots}$
    and $\displaystyle\bigjoin_{n \in \omega} B_n = \set{1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots}$,
    so $\join_{n \in \omega} A_n \not=^\ast \join_{n \in \omega} B_n$
    since they disagree on infinitely many numbers.
  \end{answer}
