\begin{problem}
  Prove that the squaring function is computable by providing
  a register machine which takes in $n$ in $R_0$ and outputs
  $n^2$ in $R_1$.
  You may use the multiplication function $x(n, m)$ ---
  which starts with $n$ in $R_0$ and $m$ in $R_1$ and outputs
  $n \cdot m$ in $R_2$ --- as a black box function labeled $M$.
