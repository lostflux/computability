\begin{problem}
  The rational numbers, $\Q$, are
  $\set{\frac{p}{q} \given p, q \in \Z, q > 0}$.
  The Gaussian rationals are complex nunbers of the form
  $\set{ r + si \given r, s \in \Q}$.
  Provide a bijection between the Gaussian rationals
  and $\omega$. \\
  \emph{Prove that it is a bijection}.

  \begin{answer}
    This... is a bijection.
