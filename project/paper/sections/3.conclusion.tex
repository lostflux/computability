\section{Further Areas of Exploration}

This paper explores the basic notions around Turing categories
as an abstract model of computation.
To do this, it needs to go through a decent amount of underlying
concepts.

To explore turing categories in an accessible manner,
this paper needed to delve into some of the underlying
concepts in category theory.
This is also a restriction. For instance,
the theory of \newterm{Partial Combinatory Algebras} (PCAs)
is a big part of what is needed 
to fully understand Turing categories,
but the field is too vast and complicated to be covered here.

If interested in further discovery around Turing categories
and some of the results that can be derived from them,
PCAs could be a good place to start.
