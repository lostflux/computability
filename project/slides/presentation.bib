@article{TURING-CATEGORIES,
  abstract = {We give an introduction to Turing categories, which are a convenient setting for the categorical study of abstract notions of computability. The concept of a Turing category first appeared (albeit not under that name or at the level of generality we present it here) in the work of Longo and Moggi; later, Di Paolo and Heller introduced the closely related recursion categories. One of the purposes of Turing categories is that they may be used to develop categorical formulations of recursion theory, but they also include other notions of computation, such as models of (partial) combinatory logic and of the (partial) lambda calculus. In this paper our aim is to give an introduction to the basic structural theory, while at the same time illustrating how the notion is a meeting point for various other areas of logic and computation. We also provide a detailed exposition of the connection between Turing categories and partial combinatory algebras and show the sense in which the study of Turing categories is equivalent to the study of PCAs.},
